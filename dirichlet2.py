Let the energy E = | G*x - U |^2_M
where:
    x is a row-by-col image flattened into a vector with row-by-col entries.
    G is the gradient operator,
    U are the target gradients (possibly U = G*y for some known function y),
    and M is the diagonal mass matrix which is the norm of each derivative in the summation.
Then E = ( G*x - U ).T * M * ( G*x - U ) = x.T*G.T*M*G*x + U.T*M*U - 2*x.T*G.T*M*U
Let L = G.T*M*G.
Note that G has a row for each row and column derivative in the image.
Let S be a matrix that zeros gradients resulting from the application of G (e.g. G*y).
Formally, let S be an identity matrix whose dimensions are the same as G has rows, modified to
have entries corresponding to the derivatives involving some grid positions to be zero.
Note that S = S*S and S.T = S and S*M = M*S.
Let U = S*G*y for some known other image y, and S has zeros for values in y we don't trust.
Then
E = x.T*L*x + y.T*G.T*S.T*M*S*G*y - 2*x.T*G.T*M*S*G*y
  = x.T*L*x + y.T*G.T*S*M*S*G*y - 2*x.T*G.T*S*M*S*G*y
  = x.T*L*x + y.T*L'*y - 2*x.T*L'*y
where L' = G.T*S*M*S*G = G.T*M*S*G = G.T*S*M*G.
The derivative of 1/2 E with respect to x is:
    0.5 * dE/dx = L*x - L'*y
so the minimizing x could be found by solving
    L*x = L'*y

The G, M, and S in the above description are exactly what is returned by grad_and_mass()
in this module.
mask should be True for every grid location we care about (want a solution to).
skip should be True for every grid location we have a known good value for.

    '''
    Returns a gradient operator matrix G for a grid of dimensions 'rows' by 'cols',
    a corresponding mass matrix M such that L = G.T*M*G is a
    Laplacian operator matrix that is symmetric and normalized such that the diagonal
    values of interior vertices equal 1,
    and a skip matrix S such that the gradient entries of S*G*x are zero for
    (i,j) such that skip[i,j] is False. If skip is None, all entries are assumed
    to be True and S will be the identity matrix.

    Optional parameter `mask` will result in a gradient operator that entirely
    ignores (i,j) such that mask[i,j] is False.

    In other words, `mask` should be True for every grid location
    you care about (want a solution to via L = G.T*M*G).
    `skip` should be True for every grid location you have a known good value for.

    Matrices returned are scipy.sparse matrices.
